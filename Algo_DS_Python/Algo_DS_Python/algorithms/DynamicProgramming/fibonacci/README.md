# Fibonacci numbers
#### The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The equation for how the nth Fibinacci number is calculated is: F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub>.

## Solutions in finding the nth Fibonacci number:
### Brute Force: – O(2<sup>n</sup>)
#### This solution is exponential in time complexity due to the repeated recursive calls.
### Memoization: – O(n)
#### This approach is linear time complexity since no subproblem is repeated.
