# Counting Sort O(n+k)
### This is the function definition for countingSort.
### Counting Sort sorts an array of n keys if the keys are
### integers --> `{0,1,..., k-1}`
### Counting sort then places these items in order based of K
### The time complexity is O(n + K).
### if we can get k == n then it is O(n) time complexity.
