# Selection Sort O(n<sup>2</sup>)
#### The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element in a list and swapping it with the last sorted position.
### Example:
###### [|5,6,2,1,7,3,8] => [1,|6,2,5,7,3,8] => [1,2,|6,5,7,3,8] => [1,2,3,|5,7,6,8] => [1,2,3,5,|7,6,8] => [1,2,3,5,6,|7,8]  => [1,2,3,5,7,6,|8] => [1,2,3,5,7,6,8]
