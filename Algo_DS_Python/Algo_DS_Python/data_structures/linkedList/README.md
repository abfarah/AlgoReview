# Linked Lists
### A data structure in which the objects are arranged in a linear order.
### Singly linked list: All items in linked list contain the data and a pointer to the next node.
### Doubly linked list: All items in linked list contain three values, the data, and two pointers to the previous, and next items in the list.
## Operations:
### InsertHead: Adds an element to the beginning of the list. – O(1)
### DeleteHead: Deletes an element at the beginning of the list. – O(1)
### PrintList: Displays the complete list in forward order. – O(n)
### printRecursive: Displays the complete list in forward order recursively. – O(n)
### printReverseRecursive: Displays the complete list in reverse order recursively. – O(n)
### insertAt(x, n): Inserts a node x at nth position. – O(n)
### Insert(x): Inserts node x at end of list. O(1)
### Delete(i): Deletes an element using the given index. – O(n)
### DeleteTail: removes last element in array. – O(n)
### Search(x): Searches for an element using the given key x. – O(n)
### reverseIterative: Reverses the linked list iteratively. – O(n)
### reverseRecursive: Reverses the linked list recursively. – O(n)
