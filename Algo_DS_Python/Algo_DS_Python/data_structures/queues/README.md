# Queues - Implemented using arrays and linked lists
### A dynamic set in which the element removed from the set by the DELETE operation is prespecified. In a Queue, the element deleted is always the one that has been in the set for the longest time: the queue implements a first-in, first-out, or FIFO, policy.
## arrayQueue Operations: implemented as a circular queue
### isEmpty: Tells you if queue is empty. – O(1)
### Enqueue: inserts element at tail or rear of queue. – O(1)
### Dequeue: removes an element from the head or front of the queue and returns that element. – O(1)
### peak: This returns element at front or head of queue. – O(1)
### printQueue: prints all the elements in the queue. – O(1)
