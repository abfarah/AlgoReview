# Stacks - Implemented using arrays and linked lists
### A dynamic set in which the element removed from the set by the DELETE operation is prespecified. In a stack, the element deleted from the set is the one most recently inserted: the stack implements a last-in, first-out, or LIFO, policy.
## arrayStack Operations:
### isEmpty: Tells you if stack is empty. – O(1)
### peek: Returns the element at the top of the stack. – O(1)
### pop: Removes and returns the element at top of stack. – O(1)
### push: Adds element to top of stack. – O(1) or O(n) if array is full.
### printStack: Prints all the elements in the stack. – O(n)
### Resize: Doubles the size of the stack. – O(n)
## LinkedListStack Operations:
### isEmpty: Tells you if stack is empty. – O(1)
### peek: Returns the element at the top of the stack. – O(1)
### pop: Removes and returns the element at top of stack. – O(1)
### push: Adds element to top of stack. – O(1)
### printStack: Prints all the elements in the stack. – O(n)
